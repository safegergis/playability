### Database Schema Design

#### 1. `games` Table

Stores information about each game, including its ID and various features.

| Column Name               | Data Type | Constraints                 |
| ------------------------- | --------- | --------------------------- |
| `game_id`                 | INT       | PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT |
| `closed_captions`         | BOOLEAN   | NOT NULL                    |
| `colorblind_modes`        | BOOLEAN   | NOT NULL                    |
| `full_controller_support` | BOOLEAN   | NOT NULL                    |
| `controller_remapping`    | BOOLEAN   | NOT NULL                    |

#### 2. `reports` Table

Stores reports related to games, including satisfaction status and additional information.

| Column Name      | Data Type    | Constraints                                                                 |
| ---------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `report_id`      | INT          | PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT                                                 |
| `satisfied`      | BOOLEAN      | NOT NULL                                                                    |
| `things_to_know` | VARCHAR(255) | NOT NULL                                                                    |
| `game_id`        | INT          | NOT NULL, FOREIGN KEY (game_id) REFERENCES games(game_id) ON DELETE CASCADE |

### Relationships

- **`games` to `reports`**: One-to-Many
  - One game can have multiple reports.
  - Foreign key `game_id` in `reports` references `game_id` in `games`.

### Data Integrity

- **Foreign Key Constraint**: The `game_id` in the `reports` table ensures that each report is associated with an existing game.
- **NOT NULL Constraints**: Ensure that essential fields are not left empty, promoting data integrity.

### Indexing Guidelines

- **Primary Key Indexes**: The primary keys (`game_id` and `report_id`) will automatically create indexes that improve the speed of lookups.
- **Foreign Key Index**: Create an index on `game_id` in the `reports` table to speed up joins with the `games` table.
- **Additional Indexes**: Depending on query patterns, you may consider adding indexes on specific boolean columns in the `games` table if queries frequently filter or sort based on those fields.

### Potential Future Expansion

1. **Additional Features**: If there are more features related to games (e.g., genres, platforms), you can create a `game_features` table with a many-to-many relationship.

   - **`game_features` Table**:
     - `feature_id`: INT, PRIMARY KEY
     - `feature_name`: VARCHAR(100), UNIQUE
   - **`game_feature_map` Table** (for many-to-many relation):
     - `game_id`: INT, FOREIGN KEY
     - `feature_id`: INT, FOREIGN KEY

2. **User Reports**: If users are to submit reports, consider adding a `users` table and linking it to `reports`.

   - **`users` Table**:

     - `user_id`: INT, PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT
     - `username`: VARCHAR(50), UNIQUE, NOT NULL
     - `email`: VARCHAR(255), UNIQUE, NOT NULL

   - Modify `reports` table:
     - `user_id`: INT, FOREIGN KEY referencing `users(user_id)`

3. **Game Ratings/Reviews**: If adding user reviews, create a `reviews` table with a foreign key to `games` and include fields like rating and review text.

This schema provides a solid foundation for managing games and their reports while maintaining data integrity and scalability for future enhancements.
